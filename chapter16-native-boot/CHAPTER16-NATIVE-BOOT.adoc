= Spring Native application

== The Database

You can choose to install MariaDB locally following the instructions on the official site. But you can also use MariaDB in a docker container.

Change directory to `chapter16-native-boot/docker-build` and run the following command to create the container image:

[source]
----
docker build -t prospring6-mariadb:1.7 .
----

Run the following to start the container:

[source]
----
docker run --name local-ch16-mariadb -d -p 3306:3306 prospring6-mariadb:1.7
----

Use the IntelliJ IDEA to create a connection to localhost with the credentials in the `Dockerfile` and feel free to query the tables as you write your Spring code.

== The Native Image

This project requires Docker installed locally. The following commands(which will take a while to execute) will create a natively compiled application which can be ran and invoked via the command line.


[source, shell]
----
gradle bootBuildImage
----

Create a docker container image with the native Spring Boot application.

== Run the Native Image

Retrieve the DB host IP by running:
[source, shell]
----
docker inspect local-mariadb | grep IPAddress  # assuming 172.17.0.2
----

Run the native application

[source, shell]
----
docker run --name prospring6-native -e DB_HOST=172.17.0.2 -d -p 8081:8081 prospring6-gradle-native:1.0
# or
docker run --name prospring6-native -e DB_HOST=172.17.0.2 -d -p 8081:8081 prospring6-gradle-native:1.0
----
