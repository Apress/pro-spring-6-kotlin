= Spring Reactive Web application

You can choose to install MariaDB locally following the instructions on the official site. But you can also use MariaDB in a docker container. (Works on the same DB as Chapter 14)

Change directory to `chapter20-boot/docker-build` and run the following command to create the container image:

[source]
----
docker build -t prospring6-mariadb:1.10 .
----

Run the following to start the container:

[source]
----
docker run --name local-ch20-mariadb -d -p 3306:3306 prospring6-mariadb:1.10
----

Use the IntelliJ IDEA to create a connection to localhost with the credentials in the `Dockerfile` and feel free to query the tables as you write your Spring code.
